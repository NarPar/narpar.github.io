<h3>1. Let's get this thing started</h3>

<p>Open Unity 3D and go to <mark>file->New Project</mark>. Call it what you want and don't worry about importing anything.</p>


<h3>2. The interface</h3>

<p>The interface is broken up into 4 parts:</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Scene/Game view (top-left)</td>
		<td>Allows you to place objects around your scene and preview what the scene will look like.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Hierarchy view (bottom-left)</td>
		<td>Lists the <i>game objects</i> present in the scene.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Project view (bottom-middle)</td>
		<td>A file structure of all assets in the project.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Inspector view (right)</td>
		<td>Displays information on any selected game object.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>We'll be using these as we go.</p>


<h3>3. Making a Scene</h3>

<p>Unity projects are made up of <mark>scenes</mark>. These scenes contain the <mark>game objects</mark> that actually make the game happen.</p>

<p>We'll need 3 scenes for this game: a menu scene, a game scene, and a gameover scene. Create a scene by going <mark>File->New Scene</mark> and hit <mark>ctrl+s</mark> to save it. Do this for our 3 scenes. You'll notice a <i>Main Camera</i> object in the Hierarchy View. We'll be using that later.</p>

<p>Before we go and add some objects to our scenes, let's give them each a <mark>skybox</mark>.</p>

<p>The Unity Asset Store has plenty of assets avaialble to download. Some, however, cost money. You can visit the asset store via <mark>Window->Asset Store</mark>.</p>

<p>I've already downloaded a free skybox from the asset store, so grab it <a href="https://github.com/NarPar/SpaceFightTutorialSeries">here</a> and drag it into your Project View.</p>

<p>The skybox is 6 textures representing the inner faces of a cube, stored as a <i>material</i>. A material has the sphere icon.</p>

<p>To add the skybox to a scene go <mark>Edit->Render Settings</mark>. This will open up some properties in your Inspector View. One of these properties is "skybox". Just drag the skybox material from your Project View onto that property and you're set!</p>

<p>Go a head and do this for our 3 scenes. Just double-click the scene to open it, add the skybox, and hit ctrl-s to save it.</p>

<p>Looks pretty, doesn't it?</p>


<h3>4. HUD</h3>

<p>Open the game scene. Our HUD will include a targetting reticle, which is controlled by the mouse. And a health bar.</p>

<p>We first need to add a reticle graphic and a health bar graphic to the project, then create a script to draw them.</p>

<p>Head <a href="https://github.com/NarPar/SpaceFightTutorialSeries">here</a> and download <mark>reticle.png</mark> and <mark>hp.png</mark> from the projects repository.</p>

<p>Now drag them into the Project View of the Unity 3D interface, adding them to your assets. I recommend creating a folder (<mark>right-click->Create->Folder</mark>) and naming it HUD to place these in.</p>

<p>Now create a javascript file in the Project View: <mark>Right-Click->Create->Javascript</mark>. We'll use this to draw the texture at the center of the mouse position, and display the player's hp.</p>

<p>Open that file (probably in MonoDevelop) and add the following code:</p>

<pre><code>
#pragma strict

var reticle:Texture;
var hp:Texture;

private var fullHp:float = 10.0f;
private var currHp:float;
private var fullWidth:float;

private var hpBar:Rect;

function Start () {
	fullWidth = Screen.width / 3;
	
	currHp = fullHp;
	
	hpBar = Rect(Screen.width / 3, 18 * Screen.height / 20, fullWidth, 50);
}

function Update () {
	hpBar.width = fullWidth * (currHp/fullHp);
}

function OnGUI() {
	GUI.DrawTexture(Rect(Input.mousePosition.x - 75,Screen.height - Input.mousePosition.y - 75,150,150),reticle);
	
	GUI.DrawTexture(hpBar,hp);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now don't be afraid. Most of the hubbub is just positioning our textures on the screen, and calculating our hp bar width. I'll be going into detail about this in my physical tutorial, and will later update this tutorial with the details.</p> 

<p>Save this file and return to Unity 3D. In this game, our player will be represented by the Main Camera. It is important to note that the OnGUI() in our script will only work when attached to a Camera object.</p>

<p>Drag our HUD script from the Project View onto the Main Camera in the Hierarchy View.</p>

<p>Select the Main Camera in the Hierarchy View, and note its components listed in the Inspection View. You should see HUD at the bottom.</p>

<p>Under the HUD components name you should see the <mark>reticle</mark> and <mark>hp</mark> variables. From the Project View, drag the corresponding textures onto those variables.</p>

<p>Click the Play button at the top of the window to test the game. You should see the reticle following the mouse and a red health bar at the bottom of the screen.</p>
